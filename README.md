## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to break the task into smaller tasks to progress more qiuckly and finish the challenge.

```css
#tr-1, #tr-2, #tr-3 {
    border-bottom: 1px solid hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on responsive web design. I also want to focus on how padding, margin and width/height really works in CSS because I struggled to achieve my desired result when developing this in the smaller screen. The problem I have faced is with the padding/margin on the small screen, what I did to solve it was to make the width of the main element and cetered it to make it appears that it has padding or margin.
